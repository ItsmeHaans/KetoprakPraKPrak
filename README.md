# KetoprakPraKPrak group's project

an AI-powered system designed to predict both solar panel input (energy generation) and electricity output (consumption) based on historical data. By analyzing past trends, weather conditions, and usage patterns, the system aims to optimize energy efficiency, improve grid management, and reduce costs. This predictive tool will help users and energy providers make data-driven decisions for better renewable energy utilization.

Features
Solar Tracking: Automatically adjusts solar panel angles to follow the sun's position throughout the day.
Energy Optimization: Monitors power usage and optimizes energy distribution based on real-time data.
Smart Predictions: Uses weather forecasting and machine learning to anticipate sunlight availability and adjust behavior accordingly.
User Dashboard: Visual interface for monitoring energy production, usage stats, and performance metrics.
Eco-Friendly: Helps reduce energy waste and supports sustainable living.
