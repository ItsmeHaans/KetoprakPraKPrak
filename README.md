# KetoprakPraKPrak group's project

an AI-powered system designed to predict both solar panel input (energy generation) and electricity output (consumption) based on historical data. By analyzing past trends, weather conditions, and usage patterns, the system aims to optimize energy efficiency, improve grid management, and reduce costs. This predictive tool will help users and energy providers make data-driven decisions for better renewable energy utilization.
